# Backend Challenge - Calculator API

## Introduction

Create a web service that performs basic arithmetic operations.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language and framework. For beginner level, no database required.

### Objectives

- Implement multiple endpoints for different operations
- Handle numerical inputs and computations

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create endpoints for `/add`, `/subtract`, `/multiply`, `/divide` that accept query parameters `a` and `b` and return the result

3. **Testing**:
    - Test with: `GET /add?a=5&b=3`

### Possible Improvements

- Add error handling for division by zero
- Support more operations like modulus

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand how to build APIs that perform calculations.

Happy coding!
