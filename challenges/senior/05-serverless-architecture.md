# Backend Challenge - Serverless Architecture

## Introduction

Build a serverless application using Function as a Service (FaaS) platforms.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, serverless platform, database, and supporting services. For senior level, you can use any technologies and patterns.

### Objectives

- Deploy functions to serverless platforms
- Implement event-driven serverless functions
- Manage serverless resources and costs

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language
    - Serverless platform (AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, etc.)
    - Database (serverless options)
    - API Gateway
    - CI/CD for serverless

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create and deploy serverless functions
    - Set up event triggers and API endpoints
    - Implement cold start optimization

3. **Testing**:
    - Test function execution and scaling

### Possible Improvements

- Add custom runtimes
- Implement function composition
- Set up monitoring and logging

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand serverless computing.

Happy coding!
