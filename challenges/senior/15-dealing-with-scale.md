- Handle millions of requests
- Design for fault tolerance and resilience

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Distributed systems tools
    - Monitoring and alerting
    - Load testing frameworks

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Implement circuit breakers and bulkheads
    - Set up multi-region deployments
    - Design for eventual consistency

3. **Testing**:
    - Conduct chaos engineering experiments

### Possible Improvements
