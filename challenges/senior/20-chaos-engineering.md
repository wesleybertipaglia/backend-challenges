# Backend Challenge - Chaos Engineering

## Introduction

Implement chaos engineering practices to test system resilience and reliability.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, and chaos engineering tools. For senior level, you can use any technologies and patterns.

### Objectives

- Design chaos experiments
- Implement fault injection
- Measure system resilience

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Chaos engineering tools (Chaos Monkey, etc.)
    - Monitoring and observability stack
    - Container orchestration

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create chaos experiment scenarios
    - Implement automated fault injection
    - Set up blast radius controls

3. **Testing**:
    - Run chaos experiments and analyze results

### Possible Improvements

- Add game days
- Implement automated chaos in CI/CD
- Create chaos engineering culture
