# Backend Challenge - Advanced Async Processing

## Introduction

Implement advanced asynchronous processing patterns for high-throughput systems.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, message queue, and processing frameworks. For senior level, you can use any technologies and patterns.

### Objectives

- Handle high-volume message processing
- Implement worker pools and concurrency
- Ensure message reliability and ordering

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Message queue with advanced features
    - Worker processing framework
    - Monitoring tools

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Set up distributed worker pools
    - Implement message deduplication and ordering
    - Add dead letter queues and retry logic

3. **Testing**:
    - Test high-throughput processing and failure scenarios

### Possible Improvements

- Add circuit breakers
- Implement backpressure handling
- Set up horizontal scaling

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand advanced async architectures.

Happy coding!
