# Backend Challenge - Clean Architecture

## Introduction

Implement Clean Architecture principles for maintainable and testable code.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, and architectural patterns. For senior level, you can use any technologies and patterns.

### Objectives

- Separate business logic from infrastructure
- Implement dependency inversion
- Create testable and maintainable code

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Testing framework
    - Dependency injection container

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Structure code into layers (Entities, Use Cases, Interface Adapters, Frameworks)
    - Implement dependency injection
    - Create comprehensive unit and integration tests

3. **Testing**:
    - Run tests and verify architecture adherence

### Possible Improvements

- Add domain-driven design elements
- Implement hexagonal architecture
- Set up automated architecture validation

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will master Clean Architecture principles.

Happy coding!
