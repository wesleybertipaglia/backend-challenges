# Backend Challenge - Distributed Tracing

## Introduction

Implement distributed tracing for monitoring requests across microservices.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, and tracing tools. For senior level, you can use any technologies and patterns.

### Objectives

- Set up tracing instrumentation
- Implement request correlation
- Analyze performance bottlenecks

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Tracing system (Jaeger, Zipkin, etc.)
    - Service mesh or instrumentation libraries
    - Monitoring dashboard

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Instrument services with tracing
    - Implement trace context propagation
    - Set up trace sampling and storage

3. **Testing**:
    - Trace requests across services and analyze

### Possible Improvements

- Add custom spans and tags
- Implement trace-based alerting
- Set up trace replay

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will master distributed system debugging.

Happy coding!
