# Backend Challenge - Microservices Architecture

## Introduction

Design and implement a complete microservices architecture with multiple services.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, message queue, and orchestration tools. For senior level, you can use any technologies and patterns.

### Objectives

- Decompose monolithic application into microservices
- Implement inter-service communication
- Manage service discovery and configuration

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM per service
    - Message queue for async communication
    - Service discovery tool
    - Container orchestration
    - API Gateway

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Design service boundaries and APIs
    - Implement synchronous and asynchronous communication
    - Set up centralized configuration and logging

3. **Testing**:
    - Test inter-service communication and scaling

### Possible Improvements

- Add service mesh (Istio)
- Implement saga patterns for transactions
- Set up automated testing across services

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand microservices design and implementation.

Happy coding!
