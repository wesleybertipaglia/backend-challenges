# Backend Challenge - API Versioning

## Introduction

Implement API versioning to support multiple versions of your API.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, and caching solution. For middle level, you can use advanced features like caching.

### Objectives

- Support multiple API versions
- Maintain backward compatibility
- Handle version routing

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Caching solution
    - Docker (recommended for containerization)

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Implement version routing (URL, header, query param)
    - Create different versions of endpoints
    - Document version differences

3. **Testing**:
    - Test different API versions

### Possible Improvements

- Add version deprecation warnings
- Implement version migration

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand API evolution strategies.

Happy coding!
