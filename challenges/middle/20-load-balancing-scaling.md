# Backend Challenge - Load Balancing and Scaling

## Introduction

Implement load balancing and auto-scaling for high-traffic applications.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, load balancer, container orchestration, and caching solution. For middle level, you can use advanced features like caching.

### Objectives

- Set up load balancing
- Implement horizontal scaling
- Handle traffic spikes

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Load balancer
    - Container orchestration
    - Caching solution
    - Docker

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Configure load balancer
    - Set up auto-scaling rules
    - Implement session management

3. **Testing**:
    - Simulate high load and verify scaling

### Possible Improvements

- Add global load balancing
- Implement predictive scaling

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand high-availability architectures.

Happy coding!
