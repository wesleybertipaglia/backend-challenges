# Backend Challenge - API Rate Limiting

## Introduction

Implement rate limiting for API endpoints to prevent abuse.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, caching solution, and rate limiting mechanism. For middle level, you can use advanced features like caching.

### Objectives

- Limit requests per user/IP
- Implement different rate limit strategies
- Handle rate limit violations

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Caching solution
    - Docker (recommended for containerization)

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Implement rate limiting middleware
    - Use caching to track request counts
    - Return appropriate responses for limits exceeded

3. **Testing**:
    - Test rate limits and responses

### Possible Improvements

- Add sliding window rate limiting
- Implement per-endpoint limits

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand API protection techniques.

Happy coding!
