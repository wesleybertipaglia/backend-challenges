# Backend Challenge - Basic Caching API

## Introduction

Build an API that implements basic caching to improve performance for expensive operations.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, and caching solution. For middle level, you can use advanced features like caching.

### Objectives

- Implement in-memory or external caching
- Cache expensive computations or API responses
- Handle cache invalidation

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Caching solution
    - Docker (recommended for containerization)

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create endpoints that perform calculations or data fetching
    - Implement caching for repeated requests
    - Add cache expiration and manual invalidation

3. **Testing**:
    - Test cache hits and misses
    - Verify performance improvements

### Possible Improvements

- Implement cache warming
- Add cache statistics

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will learn the basics of caching for API performance.

Happy coding!
