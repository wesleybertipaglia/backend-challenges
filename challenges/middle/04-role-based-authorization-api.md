# Backend Challenge - Role-Based Authorization API

## Introduction

Build an API with role-based access control (RBAC) for different user permissions.

This challenge is tech-agnostic. Choose your preferred programming language, framework, database, ORM, and caching solution. For middle level, you can use advanced features like caching.

### Objectives

- Define user roles and permissions
- Implement authorization middleware
- Restrict access based on roles

### Instructions

1. **Environment Setup**:
    - Programming language and web framework
    - Database and ORM
    - Caching solution
    - Docker (recommended for containerization)

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Create user roles (admin, user, etc.)
    - Implement middleware to check permissions
    - Protect endpoints with role requirements

3. **Testing**:
    - Test access with different user roles

### Possible Improvements

- Add resource-level permissions
- Implement permission inheritance

## Conclusion

By completing this challenge, you will understand role-based authorization.

Happy coding!
